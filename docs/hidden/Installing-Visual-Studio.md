Visual Studio is the typical IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used for C#.  It is used for writing code, error checking, building, running, debugging, etc.  There are alternatives such as Rider, or VSCode, but VS will be used in this 101 tutorial.

# Downloading Visual Studio
[Here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is the latest link for downloading Visual Studio.  Feel free to go to Microsoft's site or Google for it as well.

You are after the "Visual Studio Community Edition", which is the free version available to everyone.

# Installation Options
Visual Studio can be used for a variety of things, such as Web, Game, or Mobile, or even C++ coding.  The Visual Studio Installer lets you customize and choose what modules you want to install. 
## C# Desktop Development Modules

## Ensure .NET Standard 2.1 is Installed

## Let It Install, Start It Up
Click install.  Let it download and install everything.  It may want to restart your computer.  

At this point, your Start Menu should have `Visual Studio Community` added and you can start it up.

# Initial Setup
## Skip Creating/Opening a Project For Now
You can create a new project now, but that will be covered in the next section.  For now just skip things so we can get to Visual Studio for initial settings adjustments.

## Dark Mode
Obviously, you'll want to switch it into Dark Mode.  
```Tools -> Options -> Environment -> General -> Color Theme -> Dark```

## Keybinds
There are a few keybind schemes you can choose from.  This bootstrap guide will use `Visual C# 2005` keybinds.
```Tools -> Options -> Enviornment -> Keyboard -> "Apply the following..." Top dropdown```

ReSharper (JetBrains) is another popular alternative.  Feel free to choose your preferred setup.

## Good to Go
At this point, you should have Visual Studio installed and ready to create your first C# project.
