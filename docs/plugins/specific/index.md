# Specific Records
## Typical API
Mutagen generates thousands of classes and fields for all the records that exist within the Bethesda plugin files.  Documentation cannot be written for every class and field, as it would become too verbose.

Most data exists as fields on objects very similar to the structures found in common tools like xEdit.  The can be discovered and accessed in a straightforward manner with some familiarity with IDE intellisense.

## Specific Documentation
The Specific Records section is about the abnormal record structures that inspire special documentation to cover specific concepts that might complicate things.
