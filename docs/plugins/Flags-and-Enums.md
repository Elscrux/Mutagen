# Flags and Enums
A lot of Record data is exposed via flags and enums.  All of known enum types and their options are defined explicitly for strongly typed use.
## Normal Enum
Certain fields have a certain subset of valid options.  These are exposed as enums, where only one choice can be made.

For example, Oblivion's `Creature` has an enum that looks like this:
```cs
public enum CreatureTypeEnum
{
    Creature = 0,
    Daedra = 1,
    Undead = 2,
    Humanoid = 3,
    Horse = 4,
    Giant = 5,
}
```

### Setting a Normal Enum

```cs
creature.CreatureType = CreatureTypeEnum.Undead;
```

### Switching an Enum
If you want to do different things depending on the value of an enum, you can do a switch

```cs
switch (creature.CreatureType)
{
    case CreatureType.Creature:
        break;
    case CreatureType.Daedra:
        break;
    case CreatureType.Undead:
        break;
    case CreatureType.Humanoid:
        break;
    case CreatureType.Horse:
        break;
    case CreatureType.Giant:
        break;
}
```
### Unknown Flags
Enums only list the values that are known and have "nicknames".  Sometimes mods have values for things that are "unknown" and don't have a name.   Rather than listing these, Mutagen opts to only list known values to keep things clean.

You can still get at and set these values, though.  Enums in C# are backed by `int` (or other numeric primitives), and so you can write code like this:
```cs
// Set an enum to an unknown value
CreatureType e = (CreatureType)13; 

// Check if it's that unknown value
if (e == (CreatureType)13)
{
    // Will enter this statement
}
```

With this style API, you can still access all unknown values as needed.

## Flags Enum
Certain fields are allowed to have several values, and so make use of C#'s flags enum systems.

For example, Oblivion `NPC`'s flags look like this:
```cs
[Flags]
public enum NPCFlag
{
    Female = 0x000001,
    Essential = 0x000002,
    Respawn = 0x000008,
    AutoCalcStats = 0x000010,
    ...
}
```

This enum can then be used to specify several flags on an NPC:
```cs
// Mark the NPC an essential female
npc.Flags = NPCFlag.Female | NPCFlag.Essential;

// And then add that we also want it to auto calc stats
npc.Flags |= NPCFlag.AutoCalcStats;
```

You can read up on C# flag enums on stack overflow for more API tricks.

In addition to the built in C# features, Mutagen has some helper methods such as
```
npc.Flags = npc.Flags.SetFlag(NPCFlag.AutoCalcStats, true);

if (npc.Flags.HasFlag(NPCFlag.AutoCalcStats))
{
}
```
!!! info Added Functionality
    HasFlag and SetFlag aren't included in C# by default, but are part of the Mutagen ecosystem.
