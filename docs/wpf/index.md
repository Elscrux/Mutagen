# WPF Library
If you are making a C# WPF UI application with Mutagen, you can import `Mutagen.Bethesda.WPF` to get some tooling related to Bethesda specific content.

- Controls for Bethesda specific concepts, such as FormKeyPickers, LoadOrder displays, etc
- Reflection powered settings editor
- ValueConverters for binding things like Visibility to whether a FormKey can be looked up

The Mutagen repository has a [Test Display](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen/tree/release/Mutagen.Bethesda.WPF.TestDisplay) WPF app, which flexes a lot of these controls, and can be a good tutorial for how to use them.
